## **Policy elements**&#x20;

### **Confidential data**

&#x20;Confidential data is secret and valuable. Confidential data handled by Kotani Pay includes&#x20;

* KYC data such as official names, date of birth, government identification data
* Data of customers/partners/vendors&#x20;
* Internal innovations including code base and APIs&#x20;
* Customer lists (existing and prospective)&#x20;

All employees are obliged to protect this data. In this policy, we will give our employees instructions on how to avoid security breaches.&#x20;

### **Protect personal and company devices**&#x20;

When employees use their digital devices to access company emails or accounts, they introduce security risks to our data. We advise our employees to keep their personal and company-issued computers, tablets and cell phones secure. They do this by&#x20;

* Keeping all devices and passwords protected.&#x20;
* Choosing and upgrading antivirus software.&#x20;
* Ensure they do not leave their devices exposed or unattended.&#x20;
* Install security updates of browsers and systems monthly or as soon as updates are available.&#x20;
* Log into company accounts and systems through secure and private networks only.&#x20;

We also advise our employees to avoid accessing internal systems and accounts from other people‚Äôs devices or lending their own devices to others. When new hires receive company-issued equipment they will receive instructions for&#x20;

* Disk encryption setup&#x20;
* Password management tool setup&#x20;
* Installation of antivirus/ anti-malware software

They should follow instructions to protect their devices and refer to our technology department if they have any questions.&#x20;

### **Keep emails safe**&#x20;

Emails often host scams and malicious software (e.g. worms.) To avoid virus infection or data theft, we instruct employees to&#x20;

* Avoid opening attachments and clicking on links when the content is not adequately explained&#x20;
* Be suspicious of clickbait titles&#x20;
* Check email and names of people they received a message from to ensure they are legitimate.
* Look for inconsistencies or give-aways (e.g. grammar mistakes, capital letters, an excessive number of exclamation marks.)&#x20;

If an employee isn‚Äôt sure that an email they received is safe, they can refer to our technical department for advice.&#x20;

### **Kotani Pay‚Äôs General Good Practice to prevent computer virus, Trojan, spyware or other malware infection**&#x20;

While using computers and other devices, it is important to safeguard from the likelihood of malicious software infections. The following list outlines good practices to prevent such attacks:&#x20;

* Do not open emails from unknown senders.
* Don‚Äôt click on any links within emails that seem suspicious or from unknown senders.
* Don‚Äôt install any software on company-issued computers without prior approval from IT Dept.
* Only open websites that you know. Never randomly click a link as it may direct you to a malicious website or trick you to download an infected file or program.&#x20;
* When using USB flash drives, thumb drives or any other removable drives, make sure you scan them using your security software. The best practice is to ask the IT dept. to scan if you‚Äôre not too sure.&#x20;
* Limit the amount of information that is published on the internet about yourself or about Kotani Pay. This can be used for social engineering.
* Report any suspicious computer activity to the IT Department. right away.
* Educate yourself on the protection systems that are installed on your computer and check if it is up to date or has any alerts.
* Never leave your computer unattended while outside the company offices where anyone could plug in a USB device. As a best practice always lock your computer session before leaving your computer unattended.&#x20;

### _Manage passwords properly_

Password leaks are dangerous since they can compromise our entire infrastructure. Not only should passwords be secure so they won‚Äôt be easily hacked, but they should also remain secret. For this reason, we advise our employees to&#x20;

* Choose passwords with at least eight characters (including capital and lower-case letters, numbers and symbols) and avoid information that can be easily guessed (e.g. birthdays.)&#x20;
* Remember passwords instead of writing them down. If employees need to write their passwords, they are obliged to keep the paper or digital document confidential and destroy it when their work is done.&#x20;
* Exchange credentials only when absolutely necessary with the approval of the technology department.&#x20;
* Change their passwords every two months.&#x20;

Remembering a large number of passwords can be daunting. We will purchase the services of a password management tool that generates and stores passwords. Employees are obliged to create a secure password for the tool itself, following the above-mentioned advice.&#x20;

### Transfer data securely&#x20;

Transferring data introduces a security risk. Employees must observe the following: Transferring sensitive data (e.g. customer information, employee records) to personal devices or personal accounts is strictly prohibited. Share confidential data using company emails and workspaces and not over personal channels. Ensure that the recipients of the data are properly authorized people or organizations and have adequate security policies. Report scams, privacy breaches and hacking attempts immediately&#x20;

Our technology department needs to know about scams, breaches and malware so they can better protect our infrastructure. For this reason, we advise our employees to report perceived attacks, suspicious emails or phishing attempts as soon as possible to our specialists.&#x20;

Our technology department must investigate promptly, resolve the issue and send out an alert when necessary. Our technology department is responsible for advising employees on how to detect scam emails. We encourage our employees to reach out to them with any questions or concerns.&#x20;

### Additional measures&#x20;

To reduce the likelihood of security breaches, we also instruct our employees to&#x20;

* Turn off their screens and lock their devices when leaving their desks.&#x20;
* Report stolen or damaged equipment as soon as possible.&#x20;
* Change all account passwords at once when a device is stolen.&#x20;
* Report a perceived threat or possible security weakness in company systems.&#x20;
* Refrain from downloading suspicious, unauthorized or illegal software on their company equipment.&#x20;
* Avoid accessing suspicious websites.&#x20;

We also expect our employees to comply with our social media and internet usage policy. Our technology department should:&#x20;

* Install firewalls, anti-malware software and access authentication systems.&#x20;
* Arrange for security training of all employees.&#x20;
* Inform employees regularly about new scam emails or viruses and ways to combat them.
* Investigate security breaches thoroughly.&#x20;
* Follow these policies provisions as other employees do.&#x20;

Our company will undertake all necessary physical and digital measures to protect information.&#x20;

### Safeguarding Wallet Keys and Passwords&#x20;

In addition to the above policies, this section addresses the safeguard of wallet keys and passwords. Kotani Pay uses a multi-sig wallet to secure funds with 2/3 authorisers (i.e the 3 main controllers of the company) for approving transactions. The custody of the multi-sig wallet shall be under the CEO and CTO of Kotani Pay with the authorization of the CFO.\
Each signing address is secured by a Private key provided by a hardware wallet.&#x20;

The primary custodian of the hardware wallet is the CTO, and the next authorized personnel is the CFO. Our data is encrypted using the SHA256 hashing algorithm and stored on Google Cloud Server's that provide military-grade hardware and software security and redundancy. Access credentials are held by the COO and the CTO of Kotani Pay.

Any breach or security risks identified must be immediately reported to the technology department with reporting to the core team and Board of Directors. Where necessary, Kotani Pay users or partners shall be informed of such breaches and risks in order to make necessary changes.

* First-time, unintentional, small-scale security breach: We may issue a verbal warning and train the employee on security.&#x20;
* Intentional, repeated or large scale breaches (which cause severe financial or other damage): We will invoke severe disciplinary action up to and including legal action and/or termination.&#x20;

We will examine each incident on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, employees who are observed to disregard our security instructions will face progressive discipline, even if their behavior hasn‚Äôt resulted in a security breach.

Kotani Pay Limited may make changes to this policy in the future.
