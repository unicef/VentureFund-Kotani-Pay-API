# üôã Welcome to Kotani Pay

Welcome to the Kotani Pay source code repository!&#x20;

![](<.gitbook/assets/Kotani Pay logo\_Light background.png>)

Kotani Pay is a stablecoin to fiat on-ramp and off-ramp service. The service is offered as an end to end API (Application Programming Interface) to enable other businesses to integrate and also as a USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) application for end-users to convert stablecoins to local fiat.

The Kotani Pay API enables Blockchain protocols, decentralized applications and FinTech services to connect to traditional payment systems to enable cash out to bank and mobile money accounts. Kotani Pay offers a simple integration experience.

Majority of Blockchain protocols require internet access and installation of additional mobile applications or wallets. This limits their adoption locking out the users who are set to benefit the most. Kotani Pay through the API makes access to these protocols and their tokens possible without the need of an Internet connection.

At the moment, you can only[ ](broken-reference)use our "app" via USSD. In the near future, we will also release mobile apps and a web version.&#x20;

Some of the groundbreaking features on the USSD app include**;** Create Account, Send Money, Deposit Funds, Withdraw Cash, My account and Short Message Service (SMS) Response Option&#x20;

**Create Account**: Users can easily create their accounts by accessing a USSD code eg \*_483\*_354# on their GSM or Smartphone device. The user will be issued with an account mapped to their phone number complete with their seed key phrase, Blockchain private key, Blockchain public key and PIN. Send Money: Users can send currencies that live on the Celo Blockchain to other users.This transaction is performed from a USSD command interface or a social messaging interface (WhatsApp, Telegram).&#x20;

**Deposit Funds**: Users can receive Blockchain based currencies to their accounts from cash deposits on popular mobile financial Services e.g. M-Pesa.&#x20;

**Withdraw Cash**: Users can withdraw cash through local mobile financial services from the Celo Blockchain using their USSD command interfaces or social messaging interfaces.&#x20;

**My account**: Access all information related to the user account: Check balance, check deposit and withdrawal history

**SMS response Option**: Users receive delivery reports and transaction status on SMS.&#x20;



Additional Features (in the works!)&#x20;

**Buy Airtime**: Users can buy cell phone minutes on popular telecommunications networks (Airtime) using their Celo Blockchain based currencies.&#x20;

**Loans and Savings**: Access save cUSD and cGold using USSD command interfaces or social messaging interfaces. Creditors can lend cUSD and cGold based on users credit history.&#x20;

**Pay bills and Buy Goods**: Provide USSD off-ramp for utilities, goods and services payments. Supported Blockchain Protocols: Celo Supported Payment Systems: M-Pesa, MTN MoMo, Airtel, Zoona, Equitel Supported USSD Platforms: Africa‚ÄôsTalking, Black Box

**Reporting an Issue**

If you're about to raise an issue because you think you've found a problem with the stack, or you'd like to make a request for a new feature in the codebase, or any other reason, please read this first. The GitHub issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests, and submitting pull requests, but please respect the following restrictions:

1. Please search for existing issues. Help us keep duplicate issues to a minimum by checking to see if someone has already reported your problem or requested your idea.
2. Please be civil. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others. See our Code of Conduct.

**Reporting Bugs**

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository and can be reported in the form of a new issue.&#x20;

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. Use the GitHub issue search ‚Äî check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Check if the issue has been fixed ‚Äî look for closed issues in the current milestone or try to reproduce it using the latest develop branch.

A good bug report or a new issue shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Be sure to include the details of your environment and relevant tests that demonstrate the failure.

**Feature Requests**

Feature requests are welcome. Before you submit one be sure to have:

1. Use the GitHub search and check the feature hasn't already been requested.

Remember, it's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's leaders of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible, this means explaining the use case and why it is likely to be common.

**Pull Requests**

We suggest creating a Pull Request with ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work In Progress) in the title and let us know when it‚Äôs ready to review in the comments. If the Pull Request fits with the scope and aims of the project we will merge it with our current repo.
