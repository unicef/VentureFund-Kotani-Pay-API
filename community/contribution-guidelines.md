### **Who can Contribute**&#x20;

Our community includes a group of contributors that help develop, write, and improve Kotani Pay. Anyone is welcome to join the community and contribute their skills. You can help improve the product and infrastructure by fixing bugs or designing new features.

### How to Get Started&#x20;

Find an area that is of interest and you would like to help with. Look for issues that are tagged as "good first issue" or "help wanted" to get started. If you‚Äôd like to dig deeper, feel free to look at other labels and TODO‚Äôs in code comments. If there‚Äôs an issue you‚Äôre interested in contributing to or taking over, request to assign yourself to it and add a comment with your plans to address and target timeline. If there‚Äôs already someone assigned to it, please check with them before adding yourself to the assignee list.

Tasks range from minor to major improvements. Based on your interests, skillset, and level of comfort with the code-base feel free to contribute where you see appropriate. Our only ask is that you follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth and effective collaboration.[‚Äã](https://docs.celo.org/community/guidelines#ground-rules)
